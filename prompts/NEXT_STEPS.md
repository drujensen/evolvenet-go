# Next Steps for Semantic Network Development

## Immediate Tasks (High Priority)

### 1. Training Integration
**Goal**: Enable evolutionary training of semantic associations
**Implementation**:
- Modify `Organism` to work with `SemanticLayer` instead of traditional `Network`
- Create fitness function based on semantic coherence (predicting next words in sequences)
- Implement mutation operators for association strengths and attention weights

### 2. Data Integration
**Goal**: Load real text data for training
**Implementation**:
- Add text corpus loading (simple text files initially)
- Implement tokenization and vocabulary building
- Create training sequences from sentence windows

### 3. Embedding Enhancement
**Goal**: Use meaningful word embeddings instead of random initialization
**Implementation**:
- Add support for loading pre-trained embeddings (GloVe, Word2Vec format)
- Implement dimensionality reduction if needed
- Add embedding similarity caching for performance

## Medium-term Goals

### 4. Multi-layer Architecture
**Goal**: Create hierarchical semantic networks
**Implementation**:
- Word layer → Phrase layer → Sentence layer → Document layer
- Cross-layer attention mechanisms
- Hierarchical association learning

### 5. Association Type Learning
**Goal**: Different learning rules for different relationship types
**Implementation**:
- Co-occurrence associations: Frequency-based learning
- Semantic associations: Embedding similarity-based
- Syntactic associations: POS tag patterns
- Temporal associations: Sequence position learning

### 6. Attention Refinement
**Goal**: More sophisticated attention mechanisms
**Implementation**:
- Multi-head attention (different attention patterns for different relationship types)
- Key-query-value attention with learned projections
- Positional encoding for sequence awareness

## Long-term Vision

### 7. Cognitive Modeling
**Goal**: Model higher-level cognitive processes
**Implementation**:
- Working memory simulation
- Long-term memory consolidation
- Concept formation and abstraction
- Reasoning and inference capabilities

### 8. Performance Optimization
**Goal**: Scale to larger vocabularies and corpora
**Implementation**:
- Sparse attention matrices
- Approximate nearest neighbor search for embeddings
- Distributed training across multiple networks
- GPU acceleration for attention computations

## Technical Debt & Cleanup

### 9. Code Quality
- Remove unused methods (clone, get_word, etc.)
- Fix deprecated rand.Seed usage
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Improve error handling and validation

### 10. Documentation
- Update AGENTS.md with semantic network capabilities
- Add API documentation for new structs
- Create usage examples and tutorials

## Research Questions to Explore

1. **How do different association types contribute to semantic understanding?**
2. **What is the optimal context window size for different tasks?**
3. **How can we measure semantic coherence quantitatively?**
4. **What evolutionary pressures lead to meaningful concept formation?**
5. **How does this architecture compare to traditional transformer models?**

## Experimental Design Ideas

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare semantic network performance vs traditional feedforward networks on simple tasks
2. **Association Ablation**: Test performance with different association types removed
3. **Embedding Quality**: Compare random vs pre-trained embeddings
4. **Scale Experiments**: Test how performance changes with vocabulary size
5. **Transfer Learning**: Train on one domain, test on another

## Success Metrics

- **Semantic Coherence**: Ability to generate coherent word sequences
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Next-word prediction accuracy on held-out data
- **Association Quality**: Correlation between learned associations and linguistic knowledge
- **Training Efficiency**: Generations needed to achieve target performance
- **Scalability**: Performance with increasing vocabulary and context sizes
