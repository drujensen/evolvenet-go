# Semantic Network Implementation Progress

## Overview
We are extending the evolvenet neural network simulator to support LLM-like capabilities using a semantic network approach where words/concepts are represented as neurons and associations between them are represented as synapses.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **WordNeuron struct**: Extends base Neuron with word identity, embedding vector, frequency tracking, and context history
- **SemanticSynapse struct**: Extends base Synapse with association types (co-occurrence, semantic, syntactic, temporal), strength, confidence, and activation timestamps
- **SemanticLayer struct**: Contains WordNeurons and implements attention-based activation using cosine similarity between embeddings
- **Attention mechanism**: Uses context window and embedding similarity to determine which words should be activated next
- **Demo functionality**: Basic train-of-thought simulation showing word sequence generation

### ðŸ”„ Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Words as Neurons**: Each word/token is a distinct neuron with its own activation state and embedding
2. **Associations as Synapses**: Relationships between words are learned connections with different types and strengths
3. **Attention as Context Navigation**: Attention mechanism modulates which associations are active based on current context
4. **Evolutionary Training**: Uses existing CMA-ES/GA framework to evolve association strengths

### ðŸŽ¯ Biological Plausibility
- Models how concepts might be stored as distinct neural populations
- Associations represent learned synaptic connections between concepts
- Attention serves as a mechanism for navigating these connections in meaningful sequences
- Frequency tracking simulates Hebbian learning ("neurons that fire together wire together")

## Next Steps
1. **Training Integration**: Implement evolutionary training of association strengths
2. **Embedding Integration**: Add support for pre-trained word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
3. **Context Learning**: Train on sentence windows to learn contextually appropriate associations
4. **Multi-layer Hierarchies**: Add layers for word â†’ phrase â†’ sentence â†’ paragraph relationships
5. **Association Types**: Implement different learning rules for different association types

## Files Modified
- `neuron.go`: Added WordNeuron struct and methods
- `synapse.go`: Added SemanticSynapse struct and methods
- `layer.go`: Added SemanticLayer struct and attention-based activation
- `main.go`: Added semantic network demo

## Usage
Run the program to see both the original XOR evolution and the new semantic network demo:
```bash
go run .
```

The semantic network demo shows a simple train of thought starting from "cat" and generating related word sequences.
